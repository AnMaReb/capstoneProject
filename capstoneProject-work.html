            <h2>What does any of this have to do with web design?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>While I haven't had any direct experience designing websites or writing code, I do have plenty of other skills and experiences that can cross over into this field.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In college I studied Linguistics, which is basically a study of the code of human language and how it breaks down into the various parts and comes back together to create the way that we all communicate. We looked at the way languages all over the world utilize different linguistic and social codes to communicate with one another.</li>
                    <li>My roles working as a custodian have instilled in me a desire and ability to keep things clean and organized. Whether working alone or with a team, it's a good practice to keep the code tidy and organized so you can easily go back and change things when the need arises.</li>
                    <li>All of my previous jobs have required good communication and customer service. These traits are important in the world of web design because we need to be able to communicate with our client or supervisor to give them the best design possible and to make their experience working with us a pleasant one.</li>
